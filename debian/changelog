mysql-workbench (5.2.47+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
  * New patch to get libpython flags using `python-config`
    (Closes: #710627).
  * Build-Depends:
    - python-all-dev
    + python-dev (provides `python-config`)
    - libboost-dev
    + libboost1.53-dev | libboost-dev (needed to avoid FTBFS since
      libmysqlcppconn depends on boost1.53 which conflicts with older
      boost that is pulled by libboost-dev).
  * rules: added "-v" to `mv` command (more build-time verbosity).
  * rules: get-orig-source improvements.
  * Dropped unused lintian-overrides
